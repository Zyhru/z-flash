Support for three kinds of classes: 
- Concrete classes
- Abstract classes
- Classes in class hierarchies (inheritance)

## Concrete Types

- They behave like *built-in types*. 

It allows us to: 
- Place objects on the stack
- Refer to objects directly
- Initialize objects right away
- Copy and move objects (Move semantics)

To increase flexibility, a concrete type can keep it's important parts of its object on the **heap**.
